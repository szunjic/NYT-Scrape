# NYT-Scrape â€” Express, Mongoose, Cheerio

#### HW #14 for The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin

In this assignment, I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news articles from the New York Times. 

I used Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape the news from the New York Times site.

I will attempt to deploy my finished project to Heroku.

Whenever a user visits my site, the app will scrape stories from the NYT and display them for the user. 

Each scraped article will be saved to my application database.
